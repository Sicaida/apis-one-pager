                At Apis, our primary focus is program/project design and integration: the planning, management, delivery and assurance of complex policy reform initiatives, combining the key elements of capability (people, process, technology) and transforming them into tangible outcomes. </p>

                 Apis offers services to design, plan and manage complex procurement, through sourcing strategy development, tender management, contract negotiation, contract management and transition or decommissioning. We do this across business services, ICT services, software, facilities, infrastructure, grants and funded programs. Services include expertise in commissioning and market engagement. We understand the financial frameworks that Government agencies work within, particularly in relation to meeting the requirements of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules and the Public Governance Performance and Accountability Act.
